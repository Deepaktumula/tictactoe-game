# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe game repository! This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns and displays the current player, winner (if any), and highlights the winning line.

## Features

- Two-player mode: Play against a friend on the same device.
- Display current player: The current player's symbol (X or O) is shown.
- Highlight winning line: When a player wins, the winning line is highlighted in green.
- New game button: Start a new game after completion.

## How to Play

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:

  git clone https://github.com/Deepaktumula/tictactoe-game.git


2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to start the game.

3. Players take turns by clicking on the available empty cells on the game board to place their symbol (X or O).

4. The game displays the current player's symbol at the top.

5. The game ends when one player gets three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal, or when all cells are filled.

6. If a player wins, the game will display the winner's symbol and highlight the winning line in green.

7. To start a new game, simply click the "New Game" button.
